    The write syscall seems to be very fast, any buffer size above 8
    seems to be useless.
    Keeping FlushOnNewline on won't really come at a cost,
    but makes the program output nicer to read.

    Running .\bin\Release\net6.0\FalseDotNet.Cli.exe to interpret takes about 3.5s,
    so the assembled code is at least not slower than the interpreter.
